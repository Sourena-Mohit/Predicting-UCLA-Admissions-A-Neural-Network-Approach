## Context
The world is developing rapidly and continuously looking for the best knowledge and experience among people. This motivates individuals globally to stand out in their jobs and seek higher degrees to enhance their skills and knowledge. Consequently, the number of students applying for Master's programs has increased substantially.

The current admission dataset was created for predicting admissions into the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). It aims to help students shortlist universities based on their profiles. The predicted output provides a fair idea about their chances of getting accepted.

## Objective
Build a classification model using neural networks to predict a student's chances of admission into UCLA.

## Data Dictionary
The dataset contains several features considered important during the application for Master's Programs. The features included are:

- **GRE Scores**: (out of 340)
- **TOEFL Scores**: (out of 120)
- **University Rating**: Indicates the Bachelor University ranking (out of 5)
- **Statement of Purpose Strength**: (out of 5)
- **Letter of Recommendation Strength**: (out of 5)
- **Undergraduate GPA**: (out of 10)
- **Research Experience**: (either 0 or 1)
- **Chance of Admit**: (ranging from 0 to 1)
